Difficulty Level: Medium → Moderate Advanced (MCA Level)
Backend: ❌ Not Allowed (Use Mock API Only)

📌 Problem Statement

Design and implement a GitHub Issue Tracker Clone (Frontend Only) using React.

The system must simulate:

Viewing repository issues

Creating new issues

Filtering issues by status

Viewing issue details via nested routes

Managing server state using React Query

Applying code splitting

Writing integration tests

This project evaluates:

SPA routing architecture

Server state patterns

Form validation

Nested routing

Code splitting

Integration testing

Clean component composition

🎯 SECTION A — CORE REQUIREMENTS (70 Marks)
1️⃣ Issue List Page (20 Marks)
Route
/issues

Functional Requirements

Display list of issues fetched from mock API.

Each issue card must show:

Issue title

Issue number (#ID)

Status (Open / Closed)

Labels (optional)

Created date

“View Details” button

Technical Requirements

Use React Query:

GET /issues


Handle:

Loading state

Error state

Empty state

Use reusable IssueCard component

2️⃣ Create Issue Form (15 Marks)
Route
/issues/new

Form Fields

Title (required)

Description (required)

Labels (multi-select optional)

Status (Open/Closed)

Validation

Use React Hook Form

Use Yup validation

Show inline validation errors

Submission

Use useMutation

After success:

Redirect to /issues

Invalidate query cache

3️⃣ Status Filtering (10 Marks)
Functional Requirements

Allow filtering issues by:

All

Open

Closed

Filtering must update UI instantly.

Technical Requirements

Use local state for filter

Use useMemo to compute filtered list

Avoid unnecessary re-renders

Explain:

Why filter logic should not modify server state directly

4️⃣ Issue Details (Nested Routing) (15 Marks)
Routes
/issues/:issueId
/issues/:issueId/edit (optional bonus)

Functional Requirements

Display:

Full issue title

Full description

Status

Labels

Created date

Add:

“Back to Issues” link

Technical Requirements

Use nested routing with Outlet

Use useParams

Fetch issue using React Query:

GET /issues/:id


Must use caching

5️⃣ Server State Pattern Implementation (10 Marks)

You must:

Use useQuery for issue list

Use useMutation for creating issues

Demonstrate cache invalidation

Explain in comments:

Difference between client state (filters)

Server state (issues)

6️⃣ Code Splitting (10 Marks)

You must:

Use React.lazy

Wrap routes in Suspense

Lazy load:

IssueDetails page

CreateIssue page

Explain:

Why code splitting improves performance in large apps
